--- BUGS / FEATURES THAT NEED FIXING ---
- Glitchy animations
- Rigidbodies sometimes fly in weird directions
- Enemies sometimes fall off map in start (specifically crazy platforms)
- Progression tab and/or playbuttons in wrong place
- Changing post processing effects in settings has no effect in a level
- Some ironsights are off (especially the pistol)
- Player can repeatedly crouch to get more height when jumping (might stay)
- Errors!!
Hurt effect (player won but enemies still shoot. game tries to apply damage)
Could not convert (transform values in mapeditor. player apply invalid number. example: 0)
[Loading: box collider invalid size] (reason unknown. not gamebreaking)

--- MISSING FEATURES ---
- more weapons variety
- map editor functionality
able to change public script values. example: chunks values
change color with color wheel
- save multiple sets
- mutators (optional game changing features)
- reset maps ingame

--- THINGS TO IMPROVE ---
- Cleaner Code
- Better performance (scripts)
- Weapon rework
animations, recoil on camera instead on weapon
- Models
- Sound
- Music
- Animations
- Loading should only be during game start
